2. Install required dependencies (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)
3. Organize code with clear module structure
4. Implement data loading and preprocessing
5. Build model architecture
6. Add training and evaluation loops
7. Test thoroughly

### Building a REST API with FastAPI
1. Define API endpoints and request/response schemas
2. Implement business logic in service layers
3. Add error handling and validation
4. Use async operations for better performance
5. Write comprehensive documentation
6. Implement authentication and authorization

### Dockerizing an Application
1. Create Dockerfile with required dependencies
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up volumes for data persistence
4. Define docker-compose for multi-container setup
5. Test containerized application locally

### Deploying to AWS
1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Use Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
3. Set up EC2/EKS for compute resources
4. Configure S3 for storage
5. Set up RDS for database
6. Configure security groups and networking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
